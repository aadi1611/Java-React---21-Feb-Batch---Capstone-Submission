#Agile Track System

The Agile Track System is a React application meant to simplify agile project management by making it possible for teams to track tasks, collaborate easily, and see progress in real time. With role-based access and secure login, users can administer tasks, update status, and remain informed, while admins have complete control to assign work and manage team activity. Integrated analytics and report capabilities give valuable insights to enhance team performance, increase productivity, and keep projects in check and running according to plan towards their objectives.
